# My Pesa

### Mobile phone-based money transfer service

While visiting the [Countryside, The Future](https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/countryside) exhibition at [Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum](https://www.guggenheim.org/), I was reminded of [M-Pesa](https://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa), a mobile phone-based money transfer, financing and microfinancing service. Launched in Kenya and Tanzania, it has now expanded to Afghanistan, South Africa, India, Romania and Albania.

Since it's launch in 2007, M-Pesa has changed banking in Africa and beyond. It was incredibally succesfull at providing access to financial services to millions of people who have a mobile phone, but do not have access to bank accounts or high-speed broadband connection. Moved by M-Pesa's impact, I decided to create a similar service 'My Pesa', to sharpen my full-stack development skills.
